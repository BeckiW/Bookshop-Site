#Bookshop and Rating websites! 

In partnership with Fyndiq and YDB, the idea of this project was to build a site where you could add and rate products. The site also has login functions and server-side validation. Added extras include pagination via the API

The page should have the following mvp features and views:_

* **Add new products to the page.** Anyone that comes to this site can upload a product with a minimum of product title, image url, description and category. 
* **Rate existing products.** Optional scale. 
* **Top list of highest rated products.**

_Technical Requirements:_
* React frontend
* API in Express
* MongoDB as a database to store products and ratings. 

## 🏃 Future Stretch Goals

* Make it possible to everyone to **update product data.**

* **Add more categories for rating** and create an algorithm that weigh in all categories in the listing. For example, you could have an overall rating, a rating for functionality, a rating for looks, etc.

* **Upload images** instead of using image links.
